                        <br> The E-mails are sent to sshmonitorapp@gmail.com by default - please change this address! I can make custom
                        <br> images using your E-mail, so that you can just plug the system in and the pictures are sent to you. No tweaking
                        <br> necessary on your part. Shoot me an E-mail if this sounds like something that you'd be interested in doing.

                        <b>Notice:</b> I am currently in need of a new RPI3 B+ and until I get one, everything has been moved to an RPI4 B.
                        <br> I will leave the RPI3 B+ image link up and available. Though the image for the RPI3 needs a bit of tweaking on the
                        <br> command line once it is installed. Things like the static route in place, the entry in wpa_suuplicant.conf to connect
                        <br> to an AP, etc. - small tweaks. On the other hand, the RPI4 image is complete and will just boot up if you use a wired connection.

                        <b>Description:</b> This system is called MotionDetection and it monitors motion from a USB webcam on a Raspberry Pi using
                        <br> the OpenCV API. Once motion is detected by the system, it takes a picture of what set the motion detection software off
                        <br> and E-mails that picture to you. It also affords the ability to remotely view that webcam from an android app from anywhere
                        <br> in the world at anytime. So after you’re notified via E-mail, then you have the option of checking the camera’s live feed if
                        <br> you’d like. This system is highly configurable and stable! Donate here if you'd like. You can contact me via E-mail if you
                        <br> have any questions at amboxer21@gmail.com.
